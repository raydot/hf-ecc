# Notes:
Things I didn't quite get to:
    <ul>
        <li>The use of camelCase v. PascalCase v. kebab-case is all over the place due to Vue's rules on naming events.</li>
        <li>I did my best to use BEM but was certainly inconsistent.  I did not add a SASS compiler because I ran out of time and there's not too much CSS involved here anyway.</li>
        <li>This code does not include "on the fly" (a. k. a. "pure Javascript") Vue elements, choosing to stick to the template mode instead.</li>
        <li>Comments could be better, but what comments couldn't? :smile:</li>
    </ul>
